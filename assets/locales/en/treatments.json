        "content": "The natural ageing process inevitably leads to reduced skin elasticityâ€”with various intensity of wrinkling.\nThe facelift is certainly the most invasive but also the most effective method of achieving visual rejuvenation by rejuvenating the entire face or neck region. The anatomical characteristics that determine our facial expression require special surgical techniques. Essentially, the procedure involves shifting skin flaps with incisions in the hairline area and around the ear. The so-called large face-lift includes a tightening of all structures, i.e. skin and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). The SMAS consists of a layer of degenerated muscles with connective tissue and extends from the temples to the neck."

        "content": "An effective facelift procedure starts with detaching the skin of the temple area, cheeks, and the lateral neck region from the underlying SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) layer while avoiding injury to the facial nerves. Then, the skin is brought under slight tension to the side above and sutured, after removing the excess. Meanwhile, the SMAS  is fixed to support the tightening. Volume adjustments can additionally be made using the patient's fat in the face, e.g. to slightly emphasise the cheekbone region (cheek augmentation). With this kind of double-layer lift, the durability of ten to fifteen years can be achieved.\nWhen weighing up the surgical procedure, between the mini-lift (also called S-lift) and the large lift, the age of the patient should, of course, be taken into consideration.\nIn my experience, younger patients only need a skin tightening, as there is generally no slackening of tissue or muscles. Through a well-positioned incision, the scars can remain invisible. The effect of such procedure only lasts for about 4-5 years, since the deep-lying supporting tissue remains untouched. Despite the critical discussion, the mini-lift is used very often because this technique is more comfortable for the patient and the recovery phase is considerably shorter.\nThe lower cheek and the neck areas are the parts of the face, which are particularly critical for women in their mid-forties and older. Thus, as part of the big lift, the neck is usually tightened in combination with the cheeks. It may also make sense to perform an isolated neck lift. For instances when patients complain of loose skin on the neck, hanging necks, or turkey necks. The supporting tissue can be tightened from a small incision below the chin, if necessary in combination with liposuction. For this procedure, the skin should still have enough elasticity to adapt to the neck without wrinkling after liposuction.\nThe large facelift is often combined with a forehead lift if the forehead and eyebrow area also need to be lifted. The classic forehead lift is performed through a coronary incision in a bow-shaped incision from ear to ear in the hairy area of the head. During this procedure, the skin in the entire forehead area, possibly up to the eyebrow line, is mobilised, tightened and the excess skin is removed. After the forehead lift, a fine, barely visible scar remains behind the hairline. In the case of a conspicuously high forehead, a pre hairline cut can be used since the other incision techniques would result in a higher forehead. The disadvantage of this procedure is a possibly visible scar directly in front of the hairline.\nMuch more elegant, however, a forehead lift can be performed using the most modern techniques based on endoscopy. This minimally invasive technique has dramatically changed the plastic surgery approach over the last decade. Using newly developed devices and special instruments, our procedures can be performed safely and effectively with only minimal incisions and scars. A maximum of three to five mini incisions is made in the hairy scalp through which a tiny video camera and the endoscopic tube for the special instruments are inserted to detach and move the forehead skin. In this way, the forehead, temples and eyebrows can be lifted, transverse and longitudinal wrinkles on the forehead as well as smaller wrinkles in the eye area can be smoothed. The new position of the forehead is fixed with two small short screws in the outer skull bone, which are painlessly removed after about a week. The current surgical results are impressive and certainly, promise further applications in the future."

However, the hair will grow back over the next few months.\nBlood circulation disorders of the skin as a result of excessive nicotine consumption can lead to wound edge necrosis and conspicuous scars. That may require follow-up treatment. If bacterial infections appear, this can lead to wider scars due to delayed, secondary healing of the wound. That can be corrected by another minor operation. Damage to the facial nerves, which is almost impossible in expert hands, generally regenerates within 3 to 6 months. Occasionally, lesions of skin and muscle nerves may occur, but these regenerate on their own within weeks to months.

A harmonious-looking, aesthetic eye area is achieved through the interaction of many individual components. The shape and texture of the eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows play a decisive role. Unfortunately, age-related changes in the face manifest themselves most clearly in this area.\nThe general \"downward trend\" is decisive for the impression of age, whereby not only a drooping, sagging upper eyelid, but also drooping eyelids or bags under the eyes make the eyes appear small and powerless, even if the mood is actually positive. With a cosmetic surgical intervention in this area, this impairing sagging of the skin can be removed relatively quickly and successfully."

In principle, eyelid lifting should only be carried out by an experienced surgeon, as subsequent corrections, for example in the case of ectropion formation (blepharoplasty), can lead to various complications. There are a number of possible surgical techniques available, whereby the choice of procedure depends on individual circumstances, the amount of skin and fatty tissue to be removed and, last but not least, the age of the patient. Depending on the procedure the surgery can be performed under local or general anaesthesia.\nThe remaining scar is no longer visible after healing, as it lies exactly in the crease of the upper eyelid that appears when the eye is open, and on the lower eyelid it runs directly along the lash line.\nAnother option for lower eyelid lifting is transconjunctival blepharoplasty. This elegant method has the advantage that no external skin incision is necessary if there is little excess skin and fat. The method via the conjunctiva is mainly favoured by younger patients, as only small amounts of fat usually have to be removed here."

In most cases, however, the patient, relatives and friends will hardly remember the original shape of the nose after a few weeks. Aesthetic correction of the nose is one of the most common procedures performed by plastic surgeons. The patient's ideas are always taken into account, and my experience in terms of type, shape, contour and what is technically possible is also taken into account. Together with you, the whole face and the whole profile must always be included in the operation plan. For example, a small nose can look too big - relatively speaking - because of a small chin. Balance can only be achieved here by simultaneously enlarging the chin. In cases where, in addition to a chin that is too small, there is also a misalignment of the jaw or teeth, consultation with an oral surgeon is referred to prior to rhinoplasty.

A crooked nose can be caused by displacement of the bone parts. In some patients, a second minor corrective operation to compensate for the internal scarring may be necessary after six months at the earliest.

This operation can also be performed later in life without any problems. Through a concealed incision behind the ear, the malformed cartilage at the edge of the ear is worked on in such a way that it can be fixed in the desired shape and the protruding ear can easily be placed in a natural position.

A haematoma can be punctured in most cases and only requires a second operation in exceptional cases. A temporary disturbance of the sensation of touch is normal and disappears by itself after some time. Very rarely, if the patient has a predisposition, a scar proliferation develops in the scar, a so-called keloid, which presents itself as a thick, bulging, discoloured, painful and itchy scar. Cortisone injections, pressure bandages and later surgical removal help here, but this is associated with the risk of the keloid recurring. In rare cases, infection of the wound or the ear cartilage can occur, which delays healing. Very rare is damage to the skin or cartilage due to disruption of the blood supply. The risk is increased if previous procedures have been performed on the outer ear. Usually, these areas heal spontaneously. Surgical coverage of the defect is rarely necessary. All surgical procedures require the severing of fine skin nerves, which can lead to reduced sensation or insensitivity, especially to cold. This slowly recedes over several months but can be persistent in individual cases. In the rare case of intolerance of the suture material, the suture is rejected, causing the auricle to protrude again. The cosmetic results after auricular correction are usually good. No two ears are alike, either before or after the operation. For example, one ear may be larger than the other and protrude further. The cartilage structure may also be different from the other. Even after the operation, the result can still change due to scarring or the restoring forces of the cartilage, so that a deformation of the auricle can occur again. A second surgical procedure can correct the results again in such cases."

A short period of immobilisation after the operation using plaster restraints is recommended in order to achieve an optimal, symmetrical result.\nThe same approach is chosen for chin reduction, whereby a harmonious profile contouring can be achieved here by simply removing the bone protrusion.

With the textured implant surface, the risk of capsule formation with sometimes painful hardening of the breast is significantly reduced. There is currently a choice of filling substances such as saline solution and silicone gel. Soya oil, which was offered in the past, was withdrawn from the market in 1999 because of undesirable side effects. The hydrogel was also withdrawn in Great Britain in December 2000 due to a lack of long-term studies that could prove its safe use.\nWhich implant is ultimately used should be decided by the attending physician in consultation with the patient. We recommend only cross-linked silicone gel-filled prostheses to our patients and use only the highest quality and safest brand products. Due to an outstanding variety of advantages, such as pleasant, soft consistency, thorough medical research and excellent stability, these products have proven their worth over decades. The discussions in the media about the harmfulness of silicone or the implants bursting when diving or in an aeroplane are finally a thing of the past. Silicon as a component of silicone is the second most common element on earth and one of the most intensively researched materials in medicine. It has undergone extensive safety testing and is also widely used in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries in a harmless way.\nAlternatives such as saline or hydrogel are more fluid than silicone gel and therefore inelastic with unsatisfactory tactile sensation or continuous for the implant shell, so that, unlike silicone gel, there can be undesirable volume fluctuations.\nIn 2017, a rare form of lymphoma, Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), caused by textured implants was reported. Due to this observation, the macrotextured implants were withdrawn from the market. \nDifferent shapes are used. There are round, transverse oval teardrop and anatomically shaped implants that are implanted either above or below the pectoral muscle. Access can be from a small incision in the breast fold, axillary or at the areola.\nThe procedure for the best result depends on the given breast shape, the thickness of the breast gland tissue and, last but not least, the individual wishes of the patient. To achieve an optimal breast shape, an additional breast lift may occasionally be necessary."

Depending on your disposition, this capsule can harden (Capsular Fibrosis), making the breast feel firmer than normal. Such hardening can vary in severity and, in the worst cases, can lead to pain, displacement of the implant or deformation of the breast. In rare cases (about 5%), a new operation is necessary to widen the implant site or replace the implant.\nLike all plastics, silicone pads are subject to certain material fatigue, which can lead to defects in the covering. Moreover, the implants can also be injured and burst as a result of breast trauma, e.g. due to serious accidents. The double-walled covering offers a high degree of protection in this case, but it can still happen that filling material leaks into the surrounding tissue. In the case of implants with saline filling, this is completely harmless, as saline is completely absorbed by the body within a few hours. With other filling materials, so-called siliconomas can develop after months or years due to tissue reactions.\nDepending on the position of the skin incision, the feeling at the nipple can be temporarily impaired, especially with large implants. In exceptional cases, wound healing problems, haematomas, infections and seroma formations can occur, which can lead to the implant having to be temporarily removed.\nIf you are a woman of an age where you have regular mammography examinations, you should always inform your doctor about your breast implant, as it can affect the examination results.\nPostoperative bleeding is extremely rare but may still occur 1 to 2 days after surgery."

In most cases, a simultaneous correction of the position and size of the areola is necessary.\nBy preserving the blood vessels and nerves at the nipple, the sensation, as well as the ability to breastfeed, is generally not restricted. The scar pattern in the classic standard method is also called an anchor-shaped or inverted T incision with a vertical scar and a transverse scar in the breast fold.\nDepending on the size of the breast and the elasticity of the skin, a minor-scar technique (according to Lejour) with a vertical gathering suture can also be used, in which the transverse scar in the breast fold can be dispensed with. Thanks to the shrinking tendency of the elastic skin, the pleated gathered suture is completely smoothed out in the following weeks.\nWith the T-incision, the patient can see the result immediately after the operation, with the minor-scar technique it takes about 2-3 months to achieve the final result."

In certain cases, however, it may be necessary to pre-expand the tissue by means of a silicone sleeve (expander) which can be filled with saline via a valve.\nIf the skin is sufficiently expanded after 3 months, the expander can be exchanged for a definitive silicone implant. This can be placed either between the skin and the pectoral muscle (subcutaneous) or under the pectoral muscle (submuscular). The disadvantage of subcutaneous placement is the visibility and palpability of the implant with the increased risk of capsular fibrosis of about 25%. The submuscular position therefore offers better soft tissue coverage of the implant with a significantly lower rate of capsular fibrosis of less than 10%, but can comparatively lead to an undesirable rounder shape."

Various methods are available. Pure skin flaps from the upper abdomen (abdominal advancement) with rather unsatisfactory cosmetic results or skin fat flaps from the abdominal or buttock region (DIEP or S-GAP flap) freely transferred on a vascular pedicle can be used.\nHowever, it must be taken into account that the tissue of the chest wall, including the connecting vessels running there, may show severe hardening with reduced blood circulation due to any necessary post-radiation. In these cases, a free tissue transfer with microsurgical vessel connection would involve too high a risk of total skin flap loss.\nThe skin muscle flaps from the back (latissimus dorsi-flap) or from the abdomen (TRAM-flap) offer greater safety. They are very suitable for breast reconstruction and leave unproblematic, cosmetically acceptable scars in the area of removal. The latissimus dorsi is a large, flat muscle of the back, which in its lower attachment is detached from a small island of skin and pivoted towards the chest wall. The upper vascular pedicle is not severed in the process, so that the blood supply is permanently guaranteed. In order to achieve a correspondingly large breast volume, an additional breast implant may be necessary under the muscle flap. Movement restrictions due to the absence of the muscle on the back do not occur.\nThe TRAM abdominal skin flap is recommended for patients who offer an excess of skin fat tissue in the lower abdominal area, e.g. due to pregnancy or dietary reasons. By detaching a longitudinal strip of muscle that contains the feeding vessels for the abdominal flap, a comparatively large piece of skin can be swung up towards the chest wall and formed into a new breast. A pleasant side effect of this operation is the tummy tuck, which is generally very welcomed by patients.\nThanks to the thus abundant skin fat tissue available, an additional implant can be dispensed with in breast reconstruction. In the case of very large breasts on the healthy opposite side, an additional approximation reduction can be carried out if desired.\nThanks to the thus abundant available skin fat tissue, an additional implant can be dispensed with in breast reconstruction. In the case of very large breasts on the healthy opposite side, an additional approximation reduction can be carried out if desired.\nFor the reconstruction of the nipple, the upper part is removed tangentially from the healthy side and implanted in the appropriate place on the opposite side. The region of removal heals without any problems and the areola can be reconstructed by tattooing in the appropriate individual skin colour and size. This way, there are no additional scars or tissue losses, because in our opinion, using skin from the pubic area or other regions is unnecessary and offers no cosmetic advantages."

        "content": "Unfortunately, no one escapes the genetic ageing process. In the course of life, wrinkles and signs of ageing appear, especially on the face, due to various influencing factors. A distinction is made between mimic and static wrinkles. Mimic wrinkles are caused by a muscle pull under the skin, e.g. frown lines and laugh lines. A permanent pull of the muscles over years thus causes corresponding wrinkles, which even persist from a certain point onwards if no facial mimicry is carried out. \nAge-related or static wrinkles, on the other hand, are caused by loss and displacement of the fat pads in the face. In addition, there is a loss of elastin and collagen fibres in the subcutaneous tissue.\nThese only produce new fibres at a slower rate in old age and slacken over time. Furthermore, the quality of the collagen and elastin fibres is no longer as high and durable as it was in youth, so that in the long run there is a loss of these fibres.\nOther external factors such as sunlight, heat and cold, injuries, stress, smoking etc. have a negative effect on the longevity of the collagen fibres. Natural skin ageing is therefore nothing more than a disturbance of a dynamic balance between the breakdown and new production of elastin and collagen fibres, as well as a redistribution of the fat pads in the face."

            "content": "Chemical peeling is a chemically induced peeling treatment of the skin. This local method is used to remove small wrinkles, cornifications or even superficial pigment spots, such as the so-called age spots. It is also suitable for improving the appearance of acne scars. When performed professionally, medical peeling can optically rejuvenate the sun-damaged face, which has been pre-aged by wind and weather, by years.\nDepending on the intended skin depth, different substances are used. The most common are vitamin A acid, glycolic acid, trichloroacetic acid and phenol, which is particularly effective. The use of peeling substances, especially phenol, should only be reserved for experienced practitioners, as there are several special points to be considered beforehand. In contrast to dermabrasion, the abrasion of the skin, the extent of which can be precisely determined by the surgeon himself, the depth of penetration of the peeling substances depends on various factors. This can result in deeper layers of skin being unintentionally affected, which would result in undesirable scarring. Basically, the procedure begins with a careful cleansing and degreasing of the skin. The solution is always applied at the lowest concentration for the first application. The patient then feels a rapid onset of action with a slight burning sensation and warmth on the skin. After several applications, a milky coating finally forms. This desired effect is thus achieved and the process is finished. In the following time, a rejection of the superficial skin layers becomes apparent. This exfoliation is completed after about 12 weeks, leaving behind rosy, fresh, and smooth skin. After each peeling procedure, it is important to consistently apply cream to the treated areas and protect them with a hypoallergenic sunscreen. Without proper protection, sunbathing is not allowed before six months have passed."

During this high-speed abrasion with diamond-coated abrasive heads, it is important to remove the skin as evenly as possible so that a smooth, new surface can form. If the abrasion is too superficial, the desired effect of smoothing wrinkles will not be achieved. If, on the other hand, the abrasion is too deep, the skin reacts with scarring, just as with any other deeper injury. Here, too, it is clear that this otherwise relatively simple and low-risk procedure should only be carried out by an experienced practitioner.\nAfter dermabrasion, the wound surface is generally covered with a scab within 2 days, which detaches and spontaneously rejects after about 8-10 days. After complete shedding, a delicate pink skin is revealed, which is still extremely sensitive in the beginning. Aftercare of the smooth skin is also very important here, as with the peeling procedure. Cosmetic creams or make-up are allowed after 2 weeks at the earliest, and the already mentioned instructions regarding UV exposure should also be followed for at least half a year."

The domain of the so-called \"skin-resurfacing\" are the fine (intradermal) wrinkles and texture changes of the ageing skin, which can hardly be repaired during a face-lift.\nThe technical prerequisite for a positive effect of this treatment method is a sufficiently high energy output of the laser in a very short time, so that the skin does not burn itself but vaporises directly. The ERBIUM-YAG laser, for example, is used for this purpose. In addition to its precise skin ablation, another effect occurs (the so-called \"shrinking\"). In addition to the regeneration of the upper skin layers, the collagen connective tissue is restructured. The result is a tightening of the entire treatment area.\nAs with dermabrasion, scab formation also occurs in the first few days after the treatment. The detachment of the scab is completed after approx. 5-7 days, whereby a special treatment with panthenol ointments is recommended. Any residual reddening that initially remains generally subsides completely within 2-3 months, although strict UV protection must also be observed here to avoid staining. Should a new treatment be necessary after about 3-5 years, this is possible without any problems."

It should be emphasised that we only use harmless preparations that are not hazardous to health. We do not use any products of animal origin, such as collagen. Instead, we prefer purely synthetically produced substances, such as hyaluronic acid, which, due to the lack of protein components, do not require allergy testing in advance and are characterised by excellent tissue compatibility. By this means, we can look back on a complication-free application with convincing satisfaction among our patients in the past years. However, the exact injection technique is an absolute prerequisite for an even leveling of the skin. In the case of so-called absorbable substances, repetitions are usually necessary, as the relining effect can diminish after about half a year due to degradation processes in the tissue.

However, this method could only partially fulfil expectations. The most convincing advantage of autologous fat injection is that it can be applied over a large area and is relatively easy to obtain from the body's own depots. In an operation (under general or local anaesthesia), your fat is extracted from the appropriate depots, specially and elaborately processed, and then injected into your face. Own fat not only has volume-giving properties but also has a skin-refreshing or rejuvenating effect due to the stem cells and growth factors. The grown and transplanted own fat lasts permanently and is subject to your weight fluctuations as well as your skin ageing. The decisive disadvantage, however, is the high resorption rate. Since only a small part of each fat transplant is connected to the blood supply of the recipient area, up to 60% of the transported fat cells are resorbed within only 2-3 months."

The active ingredient of this preparation, botulinum toxin, is a neurotoxin from neurology that had been tried and tested for decades and has found its way into cosmetic surgery due to its wrinkle-smoothing effect. Here a harmless, extremely effective application is guaranteed when used professionally, as a clearly visible rejuvenation and harmonisation of the facial features can be achieved by weakening the overactive mimic musculature in these areas. The fact that wrinkle treatment with injectable materials continues to grow despite the initial lowering of expectations is explained by the elegance of these procedures. There is no comparable method that enables an immediate, visible improvement of the outer appearance in a few minutes in a biological way, without any significant impairment of the patient.\nThe treatment with botulinum toxin leads to a temporary paralysis of the facial muscles and is mostly applied in the upper third of the face. Thus, the frown line region as well as the forehead region and crow's feet can be treated. In some cases, it is also indicated to work with very little Botox amounts in the area of the mouth or nose.

        "content": "The Vampire Lift (also known as PRP therapy or Platelet-Rich Plasma therapy) is a young procedure for gentle skin rejuvenation on the face, neck and dÃ©colletÃ©. The treatment method was developed in the USA and quickly became popular there, especially among prominent actresses and singers. The procedure is called \"vampire lift\" because a small amount (approx. 20 ml) of the patient's own blood is taken for the treatment. From this own blood we obtain platelet-rich plasma, which is injected into the areas of skin to be regenerated. The platelet-rich plasma not only ensures tissue regeneration. Thanks to the growth factors it contains, it also promotes the formation of new cells.\nYou do not have to expect any side effects. This is because only the body's own filling material (blood plasma) is used for the treatment. Allergies and intolerance reactions can therefore be virtually ruled out. Unpleasant after-effects of the treatment can at most be expressed by slight swellings in the injection areas. However, these symptoms will disappear within a few days. Since the Vampire Lift does not require any skin incisions, the procedure does not leave any scar tissue. The growth factors contained in the blood plasma ensure lasting treatment success. Hair loss (alopecia) can also be treated with this method. The treatment is usually carried out 4 times at intervals of 4-6 weeks. \nWe obtain the autologous blood required for the treatment from a suitable vein. The prepared blood plasma enters your subcutaneous tissue through fine needles and special techniques. Depending on the treatment objective, the plasma is injected in one or more layers.\nThe Vampire Lift takes about 20 minutes per treatment unit and is therefore comparatively time-consuming. Depending on the desired extent of treatment and the individual response to the measure, a Vampire Lift extends over 1 to 4 successive treatment units at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks.\nOften, the visual treatment successes are already apparent a few days after the Vampire Lift. Since the procedure stimulates the formation of new cells, you usually benefit from the therapy in the long term."

Typical areas of application are the abdomen, hips, legs, double chin and the male breast.
