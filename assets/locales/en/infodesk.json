            "subtitle": "Find out more in your personal environment (friends, family). Nothing is better than a personal recommendation, but here too you can be lucky or unlucky. Sources of information such as the Internet or forums are very helpful when searching. However, there are always some points to consider. Is the doctor you came across through your search a specialist in plastic & aesthetic surgery? Or just a surgeon or an ear, nose and throat doctor? Make at least 2 consultation appointments!"

            "subtitle": "After the interview, you should have the impression that you know everything you need to know. Now you have to decide. Don't let yourself be put under pressure! All aesthetic interventions can be planned in peace. Statements such as: 'We can only operate on you this week or if you come tomorrow it is particularly cheap' should make you think. Basically: a serious doctor will never have a problem if you want to get a second medical opinion before making your final decision. If you decide now, trust your feelings. If there is something you don't like, keep looking. You will find the right doctor for you. Price differences should not significantly influence your decision. Not everything that is particularly cheap or expensive is also good."

It is therefore possible that you will receive relatively precise information about the expected total costs (the procedure, the anesthetist, the hospital, the follow-up treatment) of your plastic-aesthetic procedure during your first consultation. So that you are not surprised by unexpected payments afterwards, you will receive a cost estimate following the consultation, which will inform you in detail about the expenses planned for the operation. As a rule, the final amount after the operation hardly ever deviates from the cost estimate."

The financing of medical or cosmetic treatment often causes some difficulties for patients due to the high treatment costs, which in the worst case means that they cannot demand the best possible service that they want and deserve. Medkred offers a simple, convenient and, above all, safe solution in this case."
